# ðŸŽ¯ About our Mission

## LivestocX ðŸŒ¾ | Revolutionizing LiveStocks Trade Through BlockDAG Technology

***

### ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

**LivestocX** is a groundbreaking BlockDAG-based platform that revolutionizes livestocks finance by enabling farmers to tokenize their livestock, crops, and livestock assets, while connecting them with global investors seeking exposure to the livestock sector.

Built during the **BlockDAG Hackathon 2025**, LivestocX addresses the critical gap in livestok financing where traditional farmers struggle to access capital, while investors lack transparent, secure ways to invest in livestock.

#### Core Purpose

* **Democratize Livestok Investment** - Make Livestock accessible to global investors
* **Empower Farmers** - Provide instant liquidity for Livestock assets
* **Ensure Transparency** - BlocDAG-based verification and tracking
* **Create Economic Inclusion** - Bridge rural farmers with urban capital
