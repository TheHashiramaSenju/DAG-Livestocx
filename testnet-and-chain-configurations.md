### ðŸ”— Chain Configuration

The BlockDAG network employs a robust set of configurations to ensure security, efficiency, and compatibility:

* **Keccak 256 SHA3 Encryption**: This cryptographic algorithm provides strong security for the network, safeguarding against potential attacks and ensuring data integrity.
* **PoW Hybrid Consensus**: Combining Proof of Work (PoW) with BlockDAG architecture, this consensus mechanism enhances network decentralization and security. It leverages the strengths of traditional PoW while improving scalability.
* **EVM Compatibility**: By supporting the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the network facilitates smart contract execution and interoperability with Ethereum-based applications and tools.

These configurations work synergistically, offering a highly secure, scalable, and versatile platform. Compared to traditional blockchain networks, the hybrid consensus and EVM compatibility provide enhanced transaction throughput and broader use-case adaptability, without compromising on security.
